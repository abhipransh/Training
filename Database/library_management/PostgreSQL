CLAUSES:

	1. DISTINCT, DISTINCT ON
		DISTINCT helps select unique values from the result set whereas DISTINCT ON helps select unique values from a particular column.
	2.

	5. Boolean	
		boolean	1 byte	- State true or False.

Constraints:

	1. NOT NULL − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
    	2. UNIQUE − Ensures that all values in a column are different.
    	3. PRIMARY KEY − UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
	4. FOREIGN KEY − Constrains data based on columns in other tables.
    	5. CHECK − Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

Aggregate Functions:

	1. COUNT() - used to count the number of rows in a database table.
	2. MAX() - used to select the highest (maximum) value for a certain column.
	3. 
	3. MIN() - used to select the lowest (minimum) value for a certain column.
	4. AVG() - used to select the average value for certain table column.
	5. SUM() - used to select the total for a numeric column.
